## Code of Conduct

Please read the [GTIRB Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


## Code Requirements

- All code shall be formatted with clang-format.  A `.clang-format` is
  provided in the root directory for the project.

- Code should generally follow the C++ Core Guidelines recommendations.

- Code should generally allow for thread safety.
	- No static variables.
	- No globals
	- Free functions should not maintain state.
	- Use caution when using iterators to guard against invalidation.

- Code should be tested on Linux using GCC and Clang and on Windows using Visual Studio.

- Maintain const-correctness.

- Use UpperCamelCase for type names.

- Use UpperCamelCase for enum members.

- Use UpperCamelCase for variable and class members.

- Use lowerCamelCase for function and method names.

- Avoid `using namespace std`

- Use `auto` when the deduced type is explicitly spelled out in the
  initialization or if the deduced type is an abstract type
  alias.  Always explicitly specify type qualifiers, pointers, and
  references.  E.g.,
  ```c++
  const auto *Ptr = dynamic_cast<const Foo *>(SomePtr);
  auto Val = static_cast<unsigned>(SomeValue);
  for (auto Iter = SomeContainer.begin(), End = SomeContainer.end(); Iter != End; ++Iter) {}
  ```

- Use `auto` to make code more readable, but prefer `auto &` or `auto *`
  to avoid unexpected copies.

- `#include` as little as possible to reduce compile times. Use
  forward declarations of classes when possible to avoid including
  their definitions.


## Testing Development

- All code you care about should be tested.
- Any code you don't care about should be removed.
- Code testing is done via Google Test.
- Test names are prefixed with the type of test they are (`Unit_`, `System_`, `Integration_`).
- No unit test should take more than 0.5 seconds.


## Documentation

The GTIRB documentation consists of complete documentation for all
components of the GTIRB API, along with examples and other usage
information.


### Building Documentation

You will need `cmake` and `Doxygen`.

1. Create and change to a temporary build directory. We will refer to
   this directory as `build`.

   ```bash
   > mkdir build
   > cd build
   ```


2. Build the documentation.

   ```bash
   build> cmake <PATH_TO_GTIRB>/doc/doxy/
   build> cmake --build . --target doc
   ```

3. Open the documentation home page `build/html/index.html`
   in your browser.


### Contributing Markdown Documentation

To add a new markdown document to the documentation:

1. Create the new document as a child of /doc.
   - File names start with `gtirb`.
   - File extension is `.md`.
   - Use github markdown syntax.
   - Wrap your markdown documents at 80 columns.

2. Edit `/doc/doxy/Doxyfile.in` to add the basename of your new markdown
   document to the `INPUT` rule setting. Note that the ordering of
   file names here corresponds to table of contents ordering.

3. Edit `/doc/doxy/CMakeLists.txt` to add your new markdown document
   to  `MDFILES_IN`. Ordering is not important.

4. [Build the documentation](#building-documentation) and check that
   your new page is present and rendered correctly.
   - If it is not rendered correctly, you may need to add a new
     preprocessing step to `doc/doxy/preprocmd.py` to rewrite the
     corresponding github-style markdown into something Doxygen
     can handle correctly.

### Graphviz

- File names start with `gtirb`.
- The color palette is `black`, `lightblue`, `cornflowerblue`, and `coral`.
- Render `.dot` files to the same file name with a `.png` extension.
	* Example: `dot -Tpng gtirbScope.dot > gtirbScope.png`
- Use the `arial` font.
